## What? ##

Jygments is a generic syntax highlighter for general use in all kinds of software such as forum systems, wikis or other applications that need to prettify source code.

  * a wide range of common languages and markup formats is supported
  * special attention is paid to details that increase highlighting quality
  * support for new languages and formats are added easily; most languages use a simple regex-based lexing mechanism
  * a number of output formats is available, among them HTML, RTF, LaTeX and ANSI sequences (currently only HTML!)
  * it is usable as a command-line tool and as a library
  * ... and it highlights even Brainf\*ck!

Jygments is a port of [Pygments](http://pygments.org/) from Python to Java. The above description is copied verbatim from the Pygments site.

## What a Weird Name! ##

Yes, isn't it? Well, Jygments is a port of Pygments to Java. Pygments is English "pigments" with the "y" from Python. Since Jygments is a port, we've decided to keep the "y" in loving memory of Python.
